      "body_html": "\u003cspan\u003eThe original. The bacon that blazed its path across the pork landscape and made Pederson’s a household name. This is bacon without sugar. Simple enough, right? Turns out making bacon without artificial nitrates or nitrites is tough. Take sugar out of the equation, and, for many, well you have a down-right conundrum. Then the cowboys and cowgirls at Pederson’s Natural Farms went and did it. The rest is history. If you want to get in on that, here’s your chance. This bacon will change the way you look at bacon, and you’ll want more of it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is Whole30 Approved. It’s AIP diet friendly. It fits right into Paleo and Keto lifestyles. The process of getting this bacon from pasture to plate is whittled down to the essentials. Minimal processing. The seasonings get soaked in over time, not injected all at once. Slabs of pork smoked by all natural hickory chips and perfectly sliced. Humanely raised, these animals get the life they deserve with no growth stimulants or antibiotics. You won’t find any MSG, gluten, or lactose here. No preservatives, no artificial ingredients. All natural uncured bacon. If there’s a better way to make bacon, we haven’t found it yet.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

This Italian ground sausage fits the bill, whether you’re putting it on pizza, in a pasta, or spicing up a perfectly balanced omelet. Pederson’s Italian ground sausage is minimally processed and infused with just the right amount of seasoning, without adding any sugar or artificial ingredients. It’ll cook up with a distinctive and characteristic Italian taste, yet that flavor profile strikes a balance with enough nuance to not overpower the rest of your dish. You’ll know it once you try it.

Long hours, weekends, batch after batch. May have been some beer involved. Bottom line, seasonings are a serious topic at Pederson's, and this bacon speaks to that fact. We rub this uncured bacon in a top secret recipe. The one thing we can tell you is that there's no sugar in it. That's all we're gonna give away. Well, that and the juniper berries.

Old fashioned food starts with old fashioned approaches. We are no strangers to technology, but we are strangers to cutting corners. We're strangers to putting profit over product. These organic products are about attaining the highest of quality for everyone involved. We work with self-sustaining family farms, good stewards of land and animals alike. We have and feel an ethical obligation to provide our animals with a comfortable life. Not only do our farmers raise their pigs right, but they also grow much of the grain used to feed those pigs. This makes for a higher quality feed that's always free of animal by-products. These animals live in open pens, they get to see the sky. They have open air. They romp, frolic, and engage in natural behavior. Our pigs grow slower than those at industrial “farms,” and we don't mind. It's more natural because we raise pigs without growth hormones or antibiotics. It’s a better life for the pigs and produces the best pork we’ve ever eaten.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe’ve partnered with these farmers because they share our values. Our goal is to produce the best bacon in the best ways. Our pork bellies are never injected with anything at any point in the process. No liquid smoke… ever. We use straight from the kitchen real, natural seasonings. No preservatives, no artificial ingredients. Next, we smoke the bellies using real wood chips. A smoky flavor should come from actually smoking the meat instead of faking it with liquid smoke. Our final step is to slice the chilled bellies into strips of bacon and put it in a package. Easy enough, right? Seasoned. Smoked. Sliced. It’s a natural process with no complicated steps… kind of like our uncured bacon… no nonsense, just natural.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0435/7819/6133/files/6014-Organic-No-Sugar-Added-Uncured-Smoked-Bacon-NFP.jpg?v=1597075930\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003eINGREDIENTS: ORGANIC PORK, WATER, VINEGAR (MADE WITH ORGANIC INGREDIENTS), SALT, CELERY POWDER.",
